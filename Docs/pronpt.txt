so i finance group , have started a game, and i'm a part of the lead developer, i am actually the lead dev...so the game was a board game and we remaking it into software
 its called: 'PesaMali'....so whats the goal: is to teach about financial literacy,tryiong to virtualize real world happenings.....so the Game, i want we have a map, of like
  Dreams, that one has to unlock next and next and next..like from simple dreams alright:example: The Smart Fund Project: COst=1400 pesa points ,Quit 9-5 costs: 1200 pesa points
  ,The Hillside Mansion: cost=1300 pesa points..so like a map, like one can't play this challenge with others who are past that challenges alright...lets me first go back to 
  the profile management: name to use, 'pesa mali points' (let me call this profile ones, because they are supposed to be like the pesa points they win with remain i will show 
  you), then also we use : Profession to rank them: (they start with lowest) for now lets have:Teachers[HIghschool one, Campus,Professor], Writers[we will have subs later,
   like Poet, Novelists, so when we want to Add Dream Cards people to play for ], get me each profession will have subs inside it , but right now not yet mayube you will help 
   me think but we have to design to allow that, Doctors[subs ], Engineer[subs], Artists[subs], Athelete[footballers..etc subs], Entreprenuer[subs]...this is for the case to be
    able to rank people and put people same pool alright, and we can use this for their leaderboard and introducing new challenges either seasonal or occupational alright, also
     they can belong to a society; where they will have societal leaderboards,...and also their in profile, we gamefy, streaks: inform of [playing game, but also Q/A...since 
     its learning we need to curate a way where each Professions /according to how they achieve they have questions with choice answers to answer, which will help them gain 
     points, also adding friends tab and checking friends to add them and find them get me, ..and a notification system to make it so sticky like Duolingo(  save streak for a 
     friend, a friend can send a q/a to you to answer get me(not dm), no messaging, like also able to sacrifice your points to relieve your friends streak..also able to share 
     to other platforms your profession, points and dreams bough card as badges get me. now continue on dream cards, so the professions have different dream cards, and we need
      it as a map, where you can't advance without certain pesa mali points alright??(you help me as a product visionary and one who has knowledge how apps go viral, why people 
      get dopamine and come back again we make that but not forcing but well integrated to flow), also on profile we have like: Avatars the can change avatars or something, we
       have now the Lobby, here where avatars of the members of the game you entering =, you can see them and their player cards(like what they have achieved- and what should
        be in lobby), so in friends list their the online them you can notis them to join you on that mission for a certain dream(if they are legible), and max of 4
        (if one choose the one to have 4 people, its between (2,3,4)  you go to the game alright, <= thats the pool now... i remember i did mention one can play with computer(human vs comp)...now we lobby
         , its start match ready right (put a good management of avatars/skins according to professions(like somehow people to spent their pesa mali points- when over they can use real money to purchase do some upgrades)
          ....the game/field now: Its a board with (1 -> 80) cube spaces, (8 by 10), the design of the board graphics (this will work on the designs, where people can upgrade),but the bboard bg branded PesaMali, and  like 
          for example you and me areeplaying we on the opposite ends, in the cube yours is a number like 1 and also 80), then in btn the cubes like show your direction how you supposed to go, so techinically you are going 1,2,3 
          but also those cubes have 80,79, not to show me from this side how i'm going get me??(make sure you ge this is critical to designing the oard)...so now everyone has 4 tokens(different colors)...and they like in
           [1 labeleled cube depending on what side-only 2 sides right], so 4 people meanign 2 people will share the origin 1, but in your screen you will yours more dominant like the others should faded out, get me??
           ...this positions/cubes should be yellow stripped alright [thise side, and your side labelled]...[5,76], [11,70], [19,62],[25,56], [32,49], [38,43], [ 48,33],[54,27], [59,22],[66,15],[71,10], [77,4] .... 
           well before even having their tokens on the board,  between lobby and having board ready for game...there is choosing of cards(Rule: Everyone should choose only 2)(each card should have clear information of:Purchase Cost and Profit per SpotReturn) 
           => for example => Assets Cards:[Campus Printing Shops(purchase cost=600pts, profit per SpotReturn=320pts), Online Tasking PLatform(Purchase Cost=450pts, Profit per spot return=220pts),Monetized Youtube Channel(Purchase cost = 400pts, profit per spot return =170pts),
           Peer to Peer Lending FUnd(Purchase Cost:400pts, Profit per spot return:220pts),Cryptocurrency Portfolio( Purchase Cost:500pts, Profit Per Spot return:240pts)]....so here the logic,  the available assets cards each one will have 2 but not same alright, like drawing, 
           i f i take one, and we are 4, i have to wait the others to pick, so i get the second get it, so the visual like pick an asset, i click one, then i can't (picked card to have like frost or something on it to look inactive or unclickable), get me??
           (this important visualizing it so its an entertaining part of the game, now there is another deck: Spending Card Deck:here every player has to get 3 cards, so they are shuffled and randomly everyone has 3 cards...
           spending cards are like:[Monthly Households Bills( the card shd be wriitten infos like: Electricity Tokens=30pts,Water Bills=25pts,Groceries & Food = 60pts, Gas Refill = 20pts, House Help Payment=40 pts, 
           Total: 175pts , so that card is worth 175 points, Hosting a Birthday Party(Tent & Chair Rental = 30pts, Food and Refreshments 45pts, SOund system & DJ =25 pts, Printing Invitation Crads = 10pts, Total of: 110 pts), 
           Back to School Season (Schhol Fees: 120pts, Uniforms & shoes 25pts, stationery & Textbooks 20pts,Transport/Bus Fees:15pts, PTA/Activity FUnd:10pts), Total: 190 pts, 
           Traditional Wedding Contribution:Teransport to Rural Home=30pts, Outfit for the event = 40pts, Family Contributions=80pts, Gifts for Coupe:20pts...A Total of: 170pts..now another deck is the savings card deck =>(also rule is hae 3, given randomly)..
           remember in real life savings have costs and their rewards...so here like wise=>[The Holiday Hustle:info on card(You helped at a relative's shop ove the holidays and earned some money,
           (also we have a condition to be followed): Save over 90 pts, (so its over meaning, like it must be 91 and above alright???), also it has added condition, statement info: 
           If you have already bought an asset, gain 100 extra points.), Family Emergency Avoided, its info=>( You were prepared for a family emergency, but it didn't happen. 
           The money is now saved. Save Over: 150pts, If you have over 180pts, in your savings, get 200 extra pts for staying prepared).lets go back to the game...
           with the board now, the thing is dices rolling pad: we have 2 dices, then we calculate the sum of them, but one clicks ounces to roll the 2( so here also good design of this its core for the game), 
           then we have now playing cards, which are contained mixture of losses or profits(like shuffled[-40 points, Overspending, Overspending has drained your money and put you into a debt], 
           [+20 points, Insurance Cover, You have protected yourself with the right insurance to reduce future risks and losses], [+60, Financial Education, Your Financial literacy is helping you make smarter money decisions], 
           [-60pts, Income loss, A significant income loss has destabilized your finances]....now lets start the yellow-stripped spot logic, so this are the spots where one picks are card in the deck(playing cards with looses and profits), also,  
           when rolls the dices, we should be able to show the person where each of the token will go using the steps the tally of the dice, and by default the one that will go to a yellow stripped spot should be given like first opportunity,
            so it should glow more , when they don't choose it to move its alright but they should be fined (-20) okay, so the tokens from card spot 1, we also need our system/logic  saving time for example if all my 4 tokens are spot one and i dice, 
            that means one must move, so the system shd move it because i can't be choosing wasting time...get me liek we shd make some moves which are the only remaining ones carried out by system okay, 
            ...another rule one is able to buy an asset when only they are above 11,   and when for example they buy it at 12, their return phase shd be and must6 be between (21 to30), the rule is where they buy it, 
            the phase of profits should be at the next phase, if they buy at (41 - 50), then the profits are (60-61), and an assets should only return if they land on an old number , 
            so if its an old number and stripped, first they pick the deck card, and then asset returns, another thing about asset returns, one cannot  be getting returns from both assets same time, 
            and the maximum times an assets is no longer usefull is after collecting 5 returns out of it alright, so after 5 returns one can buy the other asset alright??...now lets go to winning instructions which are MUST:[Able to buy the Dream with points from the Assets, Savings MUST be  ATLEAST 500 pesa points, MUST have bought the 2 Asstes, Cleared all liabilities, plaid all spending and savings cards]. i also forgot to mention in the 
            game everyone has stating points of 1200(this are not the ones in the profiel, this are for the game, everyone has starting),so lets have our calculator(like which decides points of someone in the baground automatically)  logic now, 
to know who wins the dream first, when one wins gave is over...so a loss or a profit from deck of card is added to the income pesa points, we have also liability 
points(when one spends),then the asset retunrns and the savings, users don't need to see the calculation after evry play their count of points should be viible alright,
 after one wins now we should have a good statisitcs reports, about now spending liability,assets and savings how theywent alright, i didn't get how total points to get
  the dream were but i know you can know because you know business, alroght and remember the conditions...yeah thats the game first i need you to some up with a very heavily 
  detailes to know you have understood every aspect of this game, lieke you are explaining to somehow comprehensively well...alright,detailed alright
