# PesaMali Advanced Level Rules

### Game Setup

● PesaMali is played by 2 to 4 players.
● Each player has 4 tokens. All tokens start on Spot 1 of the board.
● The game uses Pesa Points, which are the game’s currency.
● Each player begins with 1,200 Pesa Points. This starting amount is already shown on
the Pesa Points Tracker under _Income_.
The board has 80 spots divided into 8 phases of 10 spots each. Each spot represents age, and
each phase represents 10 years of life.
● Phase 1: Spots 1–
● Phase 2: Spots 11–
... up to Phase 8: Spots 71–

### Taking Turns To Play

1. On your turn to play, roll two dice together.
2. Add up the numbers. Example: If one die shows 3 and the other shows 5, the total is
    8.
3. Move one token forward by that number of spaces. In this case, it would be 8 spaces.
4. You may choose any of your 4 tokens to move.
On your first turn, all your tokens are already on Spot 1, so simply roll and move. On your
second turn, roll again and choose which token to move. Continue this way throughout the
game.

### Setting Up the Cards

The Advanced Level uses several decks of cards:
● **Normal + Opportunity Cards Deck**
Take all Normal Cards, remove the two that say, “Pick an Opportunity Card” and the
one that says “Bankruptcy.” Mix the remaining Normal Cards with all Opportunity
Cards. Shuffle well and place them facing down near the board.
● **Savings Cards Deck**
Shuffle and give each player 3 random Savings Cards.
● **Spending Cards Deck**
Shuffle and give each player 3 random Spending Cards.
● **Asset Cards Deck**
Each player must buy 2 assets during the game. Before the game starts, pass the Asset
Card deck around twice. In the first round, each player chooses one asset to keep. In
the second round, each player chooses a second asset.
● **Dream Card Deck**
All players compete for the same dream. Choose one Dream Card and place it face up
on the table. Put the rest aside.


### Playing the Cards

**Normal + Opportunity Cards**
● The board has yellow spots. When moving your tokens, always check if any token
should land on a yellow spot. If yes, that is the token you must move. If none can land
there, you may move any token.
● When you land on a yellow spot, pick the top card from the deck and read it aloud.
● If the card shows a plus (+), you gain 10 Pesa Points times the number shown. Record
it under _Income_.
● If the card shows a minus (-), you lose 10 Pesa Points times the number shown.
Record it under _Liabilities_.
● If you want to avoid moving onto a yellow spot when you should, you must pay a 20
Pesa Points fine. Record it under _Liabilities_.
● In this Advanced Level, you do not move forward or backward when a card says so.
That rule is only for the Basic Level.
● Always update your trackers. Add positive cards to _Income_. Add negative cards to
_Liabilities_. Do not subtract liabilities from income during the game. This is only done
when checking the winner.
**Savings and Spending Cards**
● Each player begins with 3 Savings Cards and 3 Spending Cards.
● You only use a Savings or Spending Card when you land on a yellow spot.
● First, pick and read your Normal/Opportunity Card. Then, if you choose, play one
Savings or Spending Card.
● You can only play one Savings or Spending card at a time.
To **save** :
● Read your Savings Card aloud.
● Decide the amount you want to save, based on the card’s instructions. For example, if
it says, “Save at least 50 Pesa Points,” you can save 50 or more.
● Record the amount you are saving in the _Spent_ column. Subtract it from your balance
and update the new balance.
● On the Savings Tracker, write the name of the Savings Card (or initials) you are using
to save, the amount you are saving, any bonus received, and your total savings so far.
● Remember: the money you save must come from your Pesa Points Balance, not
directly from the Savings Card. The card only provides bonus or interest.
To **spend** :
● Read your Spending Card aloud.
● Record the amount on the card under _Liabilities_.
● Write the total liabilities so far.
**Asset Cards**
● Before the game starts, each player chooses 2 assets.


```
● Buying an asset counts as playing your turn. Therefore, when buying an asset, you do
not roll the dice that turn.
● You buy an asset using your furthest token. This shows the age at which you bought
the asset.
Example: If your tokens are on Spots 3, 14, 22, and 27, the furthest is 27. You are
considered to buy the asset at age 27.
● An asset starts giving profits in the following phase when any of your tokens land on
odd-numbered spots.
Example: If you buy the asset at Spot 27, the return phase is 31–40. Every time any of
your tokens land on 31, 33, 35, 37, or 39, you earn the profit shown on your Asset
Card.
● Each asset can only give you a maximum of 5 profits. After that, it is finished.
● You cannot buy your first asset before age 10 (Spots 1–10).
● You can only buy your second asset after either:
```
1. You have collected all 5 profits from your first asset, or
2. All your tokens have passed the return phase of the first asset.
● When buying an asset, record the cost in the _Spent_ column. Subtract it from your
balance and update. Then, update the Asset Tracker with the name of the asset, cost,
return phase, profit per spot, and total profits collected.

### Winning the Game

To win, you must:
● Use all 3 Savings Cards
● Use all 3 Spending Cards
● Buy both assets you chose
● Have at least 500 Pesa Points in your savings
● Buy the Dream using profits from your assets only
● Clear your liabilities using your Income Balance, your remaining asset profits (after
buying the dream), or both combined. Savings cannot be used to clear liabilities or
buy assets.
You do not have to collect all profits from your assets to win.
Before your final turn, you must declare your intention to win. This builds excitement and
alerts the other players. On your last turn to play, roll the dice and move as usual. If nothing
prevents your win, you become the winner and the Dream Achiever.
There are two types of winners:

1. Standard Champion – the first player to buy the Dream
2. Golden Champion – the first player to buy the Dream with the highest savings
For the advanced level, the red spots, and Spot number 18 which are marked don’t have any
consequences.

## Enjoy Your Play!!
